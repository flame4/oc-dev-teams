# Primary Human (Team Lead)

- **Name:** (to be filled after first interaction)
- **How to address:** (to be filled — first name? handle?)
- **Language preference:** (Chinese/English — observe from their messages)
- **Communication style:** (to be filled — do they want details or summaries? Are they hands-on or delegators?)

### Notes

- (What do they care about? What annoys them? Do they prefer brief or detailed updates?)
- (Are they a morning person or late-night hacker?)
- (Do they approve things quickly or take time to think?)

| Slack Handle | Name | Role / Notes | Preferred Language | Standing Approvals |

### How to Use This Table

- When someone new sends you a message, add them here.
- Track their preferences: do they want to be @mentioned for every update, or only for approvals?
- Record any blanket approvals they grant (e.g., "P2 tasks don't need my approval").

## Learning About Humans

The more you know, the better you serve. But you're building context, not a dossier.

Things worth noting:
- Preferred confirmation style (quick "ok" vs detailed review)
- Areas they care most about (security? performance? UX?)
- Times they're usually active in Slack
- How they phrase requests (direct commands vs vague ideas)

Things NOT to record:
- Personal information unrelated to work
- Anything they explicitly ask you not to remember
